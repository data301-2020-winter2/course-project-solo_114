## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

I have chosen to use the bike sharing dataset. I chose this dataset because I think it is important to understand what factors cause fluctuations in the rate of people using bike sharing systems. Bike sharing systems are a great and more eco-friendly alternative to transportation like driving or taking a taxi, and by analyzing the patterns of use of these bikes, we can better understand when, where, and in what conditions they are most effective. I would like to explore the differences in frequency of casual users compared with registered users. I would also further like to analyze these results with respect to weather situations to see if the weather affects the use differently for registered and casual users. Upon analyzing this, I hope to be able to create a dashboard informing cities of factors affecting the success of bike sharing systems, which can hopefully lead to the implementation of more bike sharing systems in areas that have conditions favorable to both high rates of casual and of registered users.


## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The bike sharing dataset was provided by the Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems, and was originally collected by the Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence and Decision Support from the University of Porto. This dataset was donated in 2013, but contains information collected from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2012. It has 16 attributes, and it provides information about different factors, specifically related to the weather and time of day, that affect the frequency of bikes being used in the bike sharing system. These factors include the month, day of the week, weather situation - such as rainy, stormy, and sunny -, temperature, humidity, count and more. The purpose of this dataset is to be analyzed for research projects, as well as to be put to use in the real world to understand the use of bike sharing systems.
